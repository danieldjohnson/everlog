This is the source for an app I wrote for myself. I wanted an app that would allow me to record my activities, places, and pictures into Evernote easily and in a simple, streamlined and well-organized way.

The code is not documented very well and may be organized somewhat inconsistently, as I wrote this under time pressure and did not feel it was necessary to make an elegant solution. Nevertheless, some of the project may prove to be useful to others, such as the code that uploads resources through the Evernote API. (Note: I have extracted my solution to a particularly annoying problem -- turning the difficult-to-work-with Evernote API calls into nice Promises -- into [this Gist.](https://gist.github.com/hexahedria/617cbc5b50d13ce70856))

I have included a few libraries in my code, including Underscore, Leaflet, CryptoJS, the Evernote client library, the AngularJS Elastic module, and some data-conversion utilities from the Mozilla Developer Network. I have also used these Cordova plugins: [datepicker](https://github.com/native5/cordova-android-plugins/tree/master/datepicker) and [cordova-imagePicker](https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-imagePicker/). All of the other code is available for use under the MIT license.
